            <p>To give just a breif background on myself, here's a little about me.
              I'm currently going to school for my AS degree in IT.
              I'm taking this course because I have an absolute ton of interest in coding.
              So far, so good. I really can't wait to see what this course and many others may bring. </p></td>
